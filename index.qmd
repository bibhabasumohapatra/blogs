## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bibhabasu Mohapatra, a Data Scientist at Microsoft with a passion for machine learning and computer vision. While I initially considered building this site with Next.js or React, I fell in love with Quarto's elegant integration with Jupyter Notebooks for technical blogging.

### About Me

Currently working as a Data Scientist at Microsoft, I previously served as a Computer Vision Engineer at Aira Matrix. My research interests include:

- Self-supervised Learning
- Multi-modal Learning
- Representation Learning

I'm actively seeking research opportunities in academia to further explore these areas.
